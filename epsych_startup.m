% Put an EPsych checkout and all of its subdirectories on the Matlab path.
%
% Typically, it is a good idea to call this function in the startup.m file
% which should be located somewhere along the default Matlab path.
% ex: ..\My Documents\MATLAB\startup.m
%
% Here's an example of what to include in startup.m:
%    addpath('C:\gits\epsych');
%    epsych_startup;
%
% Use a period '.' as the first character in a directory name to hide it
% from being added to the Matlab path.  Ex: C:\MATLAB\work\epsych\.RPvds
% Only the portion of a folder below ROOTDIR is examined, so the checkout
% itself may live anywhere -- including under a dotted directory.
%
% Exactly one EPsych checkout is left on the path.  Any other one -- a second
% clone, or a "git worktree" of this repository -- is removed first, because
% two trees on the path shadow each other class for class and the winner is
% then decided by path order.  Note that Matlab keeps class definitions and
% live objects from the evicted tree in memory: run "clear classes", or
% restart Matlab, before starting a session from the new one.
%
% Default rootdir is the folder holding the copy of this file that was called.
%
% Inputs:
%   rootdir    - EPsych checkout to activate.  Default: this file's folder.
%   showsplash - Print the startup banner.  Default: true.
%
% Return:
%   subdirs - Folders added to the path, as a pathsep-delimited char vector.
