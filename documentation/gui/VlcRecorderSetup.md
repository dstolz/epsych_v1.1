# VlcRecorderSetup

`gui.VlcRecorderSetup` is a MATLAB App Designer–style UI for configuring `hw.VlcRecorder` capture parameters (device, frame rate, resolution, crop, and orientation), the caption burned into recordings, and VLC window options (minimal interface, always on top) against a live webcam preview.

It is designed to be embedded inside another UI (panel/grid/etc.) or used standalone in its own figure, and can also be opened directly from the recorder via `rec.setupGUI()`.

## What problem it solves

`hw.VlcRecorder`'s `FrameRate`, `Resolution`, and `CropTop`/`CropBottom`/`CropLeft`/`CropRight` parameters previously had to be set blind with `set_parameter`, with no way to see what the camera frame actually looks like. This class provides:

- A live MATLAB `webcam` preview of the configured (or best-guess) camera.
- An interactive crop rectangle (`images.roi.Rectangle`) on top of the preview, kept in sync with four numeric crop fields.
- Device, resolution, and frame-rate controls.
- An **Orientation** dropdown for `Transform` (rotate or flip the frame).
- A **Caption in recording** section for the caption burned into every recorded frame.
- A **VLC window** section for the two options that shape the VLC window itself rather than the captured frame.
- A "Preview in VLC" toggle to verify the actual VLC output — crop, orientation, and caption — before recording.

## Key concepts

### VLC/webcam exclusivity

VLC holds the DirectShow camera exclusively. The GUI stops the recorder (`Recorder.trigger('Stop')`) before opening the MATLAB webcam, and releases the webcam before any VLC preview is launched. Closing the GUI does not change the recorder's running state either way.

### Apply/OK commit semantics (not immediate)

Edits to device, resolution, frame rate, and crop are staged locally in the UI. Nothing is written to the recorder until you:

- Click **Apply** — pushes all current values to `Recorder.set_parameter(...)` and keeps the window open, or
- Click **OK** — applies, then closes the window.

Closing the window (or its parent) without clicking Apply/OK discards any unapplied edits; a status message ("Unapplied changes…") warns when edits are pending.

### Crop coordinate convention

The ROI `Position` is `[x y w h]` in image data coordinates. The displayed frame occupies the data range `[0.5, W+0.5]` horizontally and `[0.5, H+0.5]` vertically (pixel centers at integers), so:

```
CropLeft   = round(x - 0.5)
CropTop    = round(y - 0.5)
CropRight  = round(W + 0.5 - (x + w))
CropBottom = round(H + 0.5 - (y + h))
```

and the inverse when a numeric crop field is edited. No even-pixel rounding happens here — `hw.VlcRecorder.cropFilterSpec_` already rounds crop values up to an even number for x264 and logs when it does, so duplicating that here would double-round. If a crop combination would shrink the region below a minimum size (16 px), the offending values are proportionally reduced and reflected back into the fields.

Dragging the rectangle updates the four spinners live; the values are only marked "dirty" (and the recorder only updated on Apply/OK) once the drag gesture ends. Editing a spinner directly moves the rectangle to match.

### Device-name mapping

The device dropdown (editable) is populated from the union of `hw.VlcRecorder.listDevices()` (PnP `FriendlyName`s — what VLC's `--dshow-vdev` matches) and `webcamlist` (what the MATLAB preview can open). These are usually identical. If the selected recording device can't be matched to a `webcamlist` entry, the preview opens the first available camera instead and shows a status warning; the committed `DeviceName` is unaffected.

### Resolution and Apply

An explicit resolution selected in the dropdown is always what Apply commits as `Resolution` — even if the MATLAB preview could not switch to it (the driver rejected it, or the preview camera differs from the recording device); VLC's `--dshow-size` asks the driver to negotiate the nearest supported size. When the dropdown shows "(camera default)" and the preview is running, Apply commits the *actual previewed frame size* instead, pinning the crop values to a known frame size. With the preview disabled or unavailable, "(camera default)" commits `[0 0]` (let the camera decide).

### Orientation and caption

**Orientation** sets `Transform`: `none`, `90`, `180`, `270`, `hflip`, `vflip`, `transpose`, or `antitranspose` — every orientation VLC's `transform` filter can produce. It is applied after the crop, so the crop rectangle keeps meaning what the un-rotated preview shows.

**Caption in recording** holds the `EnableCaption` checkbox, the `CaptionTemplate` field (`{subject}`, `{subjects}`, `{box}`, `{file}`, `{date}`, `{time}`, `{datetime}`), and the `CaptionPosition`, `CaptionColor`, and `CaptionSize` controls. Those three grey out while the caption is off but keep their values, so unticking the box never loses the operator's template.

**Preview in VLC draws the caption** in the configured corner, colour, and size. With no session open there is no subject to name, so `hw.VlcRecorder.sampleCaption` fills `{subject}` and `{box}` with visible stand-ins (`SUBJECT`, `1`); the sample is staged into `CaptionText` for the preview and cleared on leaving it. All of these are committed by Apply/OK like everything else here, and mirrored into `ep_RunExpt_Video` — except `CaptionText`, which is resolved from the session at recording start and never remembered. See `documentation/hw/hw_VlcRecorder.md` for the parameter-level detail and the two VLC quirks the caption depends on.

### VLC window options

Two checkboxes under **VLC window** configure the window VLC opens, not the frame it captures. Both take effect the next time VLC is launched (Preview in VLC, or the session's video recording); neither changes a VLC window that is already open.

- **Minimal interface (no menus)** → `MinimalView`. Checked by default. VLC opens in minimal view — video and playback controls only, no menu bar, playlist, or status bar — which is what View > Minimal Interface (Ctrl+H) does interactively.
- **Always on top** → `AlwaysOnTop`. Unchecked by default. Keeps the VLC window above other windows, so the camera view stays visible while the operator works in another application.

Both are stated explicitly on every VLC launch, in the positive or `--no-` form, because VLC persists them in the user's `vlcrc`: an operator who once pressed Ctrl+H in their own VLC would otherwise inherit that setting in every session here. See `documentation/hw/hw_VlcRecorder.md` for the parameter-level detail.

## Requirements and dependencies

- MATLAB Image Acquisition/USB Webcams support package (`webcam`, `webcamlist`) for the live preview. Without it, the GUI still opens in a numeric-only mode (fields seeded from `Recorder.get_parameter`), with a status message explaining preview is disabled.
- Image Processing Toolbox (`images.roi.Rectangle`) for the crop ROI.
- `uifigure`, `uigridlayout`, `uiaxes`, `uidropdown`, `uispinner`, `uibutton`, `uicheckbox`, `uilabel`.

## Constructor

```matlab
g = gui.VlcRecorderSetup(Recorder)
g = gui.VlcRecorderSetup(Recorder, Name=Value, ...)
```

Name–value options:

- `Parent` (default `[]`): if provided, the GUI is embedded in this container; otherwise a new `uifigure` is created and owned.
- `WindowStyle`: `"normal" | "alwaysontop" | "modal"` (only used when `Parent=[]`).
- `EnablePreview` (default `true`): set `false` to skip opening the webcam entirely (headless use, or when a camera is known to be busy). Crop fields remain numerically editable.
- `PersistPrefs` (default `true`): when applying, also mirror `DeviceName`, `FrameRate`, `Resolution`, the four crop values, `MinimalView`, and `AlwaysOnTop` to `getpref('ep_RunExpt_Video', ...)` so a later `RunExpt` webcam session can pick them up.

## Usage examples

### Example 1: From an existing recorder

```matlab
rec = hw.VlcRecorder();
g = rec.setupGUI();
```

### Example 2: Standalone window

```matlab
rec = hw.VlcRecorder();
g = gui.VlcRecorderSetup(rec, WindowStyle="alwaysontop");
```

### Example 3: Embedded in an existing app container

```matlab
fig = uifigure();
h = uipanel(fig);
g = gui.VlcRecorderSetup(rec, Parent=h);
```

### Example 4: Headless / numeric-only (no webcam opened)

```matlab
rec = hw.VlcRecorder();
g = gui.VlcRecorderSetup(rec, EnablePreview=false, PersistPrefs=false);
```

## "Preview in VLC" toggle

Clicking **Preview in VLC**:

1. Applies current values to the recorder (same as clicking Apply).
2. Releases the MATLAB webcam.
3. Calls `Recorder.trigger('Play')` so VLC opens showing exactly the cropped/resized frame it would record.
4. Disables the device/resolution/crop and VLC-window controls (Apply/OK/toggle remain active) and relabels the button "Back to Setup".

Clicking **Back to Setup** stops VLC and reopens the MATLAB preview. No recording is ever started from this GUI (`RecordingFile` is left untouched).

## Lifecycle and cleanup

- If `Parent` is not provided, the class creates and owns a new `uifigure`; closing it deletes the object.
- If embedded, a listener deletes the object when the parent is destroyed.
- On deletion: the preview timer is stopped and deleted, the webcam is released, the crop ROI and listeners are deleted, and (if the figure is owned) its position is saved via `getpref`/`setpref` under preference group `VlcRecorderSetup`, key `Position`.
- The preview uses a private `timer` object (not `gui.GenericTimer`, which looks up timers process-wide by name and would collide across multiple open instances).

## Notes and limitations

- The preview runs at a fixed ~10 Hz sampling of `snapshot(cam)`; this is a setup aid, not a low-latency viewfinder.
- `Camera.AvailableResolutions` (MATLAB) may not exactly match what VLC's DirectShow backend negotiates; VLC's `--dshow-size` requests the size and the driver picks the nearest.
- Frame rate only affects VLC's capture (`--dshow-fps`), not the speed of the MATLAB preview.
- The control column is scrollable. Its fixed rows are taller than a window position saved before the VLC window section existed, so without scrolling Apply/OK would be clipped off the bottom for anyone with an older saved `VlcRecorderSetup/Position`.
