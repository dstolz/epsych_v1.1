# cl_AppetitiveStimDetect

`cl_AppetitiveStimDetect` is the trial selector for the appetitive stimulus-detection task. It is an `epsych.TrialSelector` subclass that implements the task's staircase, catch-trial scheduling, and reminder-trial override. This document is for developers maintaining the task or using it as a template for their own adaptive selectors.

It replaces the legacy standalone function `cl_TrialSelection_Appetitive_StimDetect.m`, which has been removed.

Implementation: [paradigms/TrialSelectors/@cl_AppetitiveStimDetect/cl_AppetitiveStimDetect.m](../../paradigms/TrialSelectors/@cl_AppetitiveStimDetect/cl_AppetitiveStimDetect.m)

Base-class reference: [../epsych/epsych_TrialSelector.md](../epsych/epsych_TrialSelector.md)

## Purpose

On every trial boundary the selector combines:

- a reminder-trial override,
- response-code decoding from the most recent completed trial (`epsych.BitMask`),
- staircase updates to the stimulus `Depth`, and
- probabilistic insertion of catch trials

to choose the next row of the trials table.

## Quick summary

- First trial: select the first stimulus row.
- Reminder requested: the scheduled trial's slot goes to the reminder row, presented at 0 dB depth. The override is applied after the rest of the schedule has run, which is what leaves the schedule untouched — see [Reminder trials](#reminder-trials).
- Hit: add `Depth_StepOnHit` to `Depth`. The step **carries its own sign**, so a negative value is what makes the next stimulus weaker.
- Miss: add `Depth_StepOnMiss` to `Depth`, likewise signed — positive to make the next stimulus stronger.
- Abort, correct rejection, or false alarm: keep the same stimulus depth. A pending Hit/Miss step is **not** reverted by these outcomes, so it survives any number of intervening catch trials and takes effect on the next stimulus trial.
- Catch-trial probability: rises with every delivered stimulus trial and resets once a catch trial completes — see [Catch-trial hazard function](#catch-trial-hazard-function).
- Catch trials switched off: only stimulus rows are scheduled, and the hazard is held at its floor — see [Switching catch trials off](#switching-catch-trials-off).

## How it is configured

Set the protocol's trial function to the class name — in the Protocol Designer's **Protocol Options** dialog or programmatically:

```matlab
P.setOption('trialFunc', 'cl_AppetitiveStimDetect');
```

The runtime instantiates the selector at run start via `epsych.TrialSelector.create` and calls `initialize`, `setRuntime`, `selectNext`, and `onComplete` per the standard [selector lifecycle](../epsych/epsych_TrialSelector.md#runtime-lifecycle).

## Trial type codes

The trials table must include a `TrialType` write parameter with at least one row per category:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Stimulus (signal-present) trial |
| `1` | Catch (no-signal) trial |
| `2` | Reminder trial |

The selector always chooses the first matching row (`find(..., 1)`).

## Required parameters

`initialize` builds named lookups (`obj.P` for parameter handles, `obj.T` for trial-table columns) from `TRIALS.parameters`. The protocol must define these writable parameters:

- `TrialType`, `Depth` — trial-table columns driving selection and the staircase (`TrialType` needs one row per code: `0` stimulus, `1` catch, `2` reminder)
- `ReminderTrials` — when set to `1`, the next trial is forced to the reminder row at 0 dB depth (see [Reminder trials](#reminder-trials))
- `Depth_StepOnHit` — signed amount **added** to `Depth` after a hit (negative to step down, toward a weaker stimulus)
- `Depth_StepOnMiss` — signed amount **added** to `Depth` after a miss (positive to step up, toward a stronger stimulus)
- `P_Catch` — the catch-trial hazard function. All three of its fields carry meaning: `Min` is the floor, `Value` the step per delivered stimulus trial, `Max` the ceiling. See [Catch-trial hazard function](#catch-trial-hazard-function)
- `RepeatDelayOnAbort` — when true, repeats the same stimulus delay after an abort (see below)
- `StimDelay` — stimulus-delay parameter whose randomization the abort logic manages

Depth bounds are `Depth.Min`/`Depth.Max`, but **the selector does not apply them itself**. It writes the stepped value into the trials table unclamped; `hw.Parameter` clamps into `[Min Max]` when the value is dispatched (see [../hw/hw_Parameter.md](../hw/hw_Parameter.md)). The staircase is bounded in effect, but the bound is enforced one step later than where the arithmetic happens.

The staircase cannot run away past a bound even so, because each step starts from `[TRIALS.DATA.Depth]` — the depth **as recorded for the last stimulus trial**, which is the clamped value that was actually dispatched, not the value written into the table. So a single pending table entry can sit outside the bounds, but the next step is computed from the clamped one and the excess is discarded rather than accumulated.

### Optional parameters

> **There is no step-direction parameter.** The staircase direction is the
> **sign of the step value**, so a negative `Depth_StepOnHit` steps down to a
> weaker stimulus. A protocol that still declares `StepDirectionOnHit` or
> `StepDirectionOnMiss` — they were never read — can drop them; the helper that
> would have resolved them was removed as dead code.

- `CatchTrialsEnabled` — Boolean switch gating catch-trial presentation. The selector creates it if the protocol does not declare it, so this parameter normally needs no attention; see [Switching catch trials off](#switching-catch-trials-off).
- `StimDelayList` — the ends of a block-randomized stimulus-delay list. Declaring it is what switches the delay from `StimDelay.isRandom` to a balanced [`epsych.BlockSequence`](../epsych/epsych_BlockSequence.md); see [Block-randomized stimulus delay](#block-randomized-stimulus-delay).
- `StimDelayStep` — spacing between list values, in ms. The selector creates it if the protocol does not declare it.
- `StimDelayJitter` — ±ms added to each delivered delay. Absent means no jitter.
- `StimDelayBlockEnabled` — Boolean switch turning block randomization on and off. The selector creates it, defaulting to on whenever the list describes more than one value.

## Selection logic (`selectNext`)

1. On the first trial (`TRIALS.TrialIndex == 1`), return the first stimulus row.
2. Note whether a reminder is pending — `ReminderTrials` is `1`, or a reminder was already granted for this `TrialIndex`. The flag is only **read** here; nothing is selected on it yet. The override itself is applied last, in step 8 — see [Reminder trials](#reminder-trials).
3. Decode the completed-trial response history with `epsych.BitMask.decode([TRIALS.DATA.RespCode])`.
4. Find the depth of the most recent stimulus trial; if none exists yet, start from the maximum compiled depth.
5. Update the next stimulus depth from the latest outcome:
   - `Hit`: `nextStim = lastStim + Depth_StepOnHit.Value` — the step is signed, so a negative value steps down to a weaker stimulus
   - `Miss`: `nextStim = lastStim + Depth_StepOnMiss.Value` — likewise signed, positive to step up
   - `Abort`: keep the same depth; if `RepeatDelayOnAbort` is enabled, repeat the identical stimulus delay (after three consecutive aborts, the delay moves on instead)
   - `CorrectReject`: keep the same depth and resume the normal delay schedule
   - `FalseAlarm`: keep the same depth and resume the normal delay schedule; a false alarm that was also an abort schedules a catch row immediately
6. Only on a Hit or Miss: write the new depth into every stimulus row of the live trials table (through the runtime handle stored by `setRuntime`), so the dispatcher sends the new value to hardware. **No clamp is applied here** — `hw.Parameter` enforces `Depth.Min`/`Depth.Max` at dispatch. Abort/CorrectReject/FalseAlarm never touch the table, so a pending step is not lost to an intervening catch trial.
7. Unless `CatchTrialsEnabled` is off, schedule a catch trial with the hazard probability described below — suppressed after an abort and after a catch trial. Otherwise return the first stimulus row.
8. If step 2 noted a pending reminder, replace whatever row step 7 chose with the first reminder row, its `Depth` overwritten to 0 dB, and clear the request. The override is applied **last**, so it takes the scheduled trial's slot without altering the schedule — see [Reminder trials](#reminder-trials). (A history holding nothing but reminders returns earlier, but through the same override.)
9. Whatever row steps 7–8 settled on, write its stimulus delay — see [Block-randomized stimulus delay](#block-randomized-stimulus-delay).

Steps 1–8 live in the private `selectNextRow_`; the public `selectNext` is that call followed by step 9. The split exists so the delay is applied on **every** path out of the selection logic — the first trial, the reminder override, and the ordinary schedule all leave through the same tail — rather than being repeated at each of `selectNextRow_`'s early returns.

## Block-randomized stimulus delay

When the protocol declares `StimDelayList`, the stimulus delay is drawn from an [`epsych.BlockSequence`](../epsych/epsych_BlockSequence.md) the selector owns, indexed by the selector itself. Every delay in the list then appears **exactly its share within each block** rather than merely on average, which is what `StimDelay.isRandom`'s `randi([Min Max])` could not do over a session of a few hundred trials.

Three parameters describe the list:

| Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `StimDelayList.Min`, `.Max` | The ends of the list |
| `StimDelayStep.Value` | The spacing between values |
| `StimDelayJitter.Value` | ±ms added to each delivered value |

So `1000` / `4000` with a step of `250` is `1000:250:4000` — thirteen delays, one block. Colon semantics throughout: a span that is not a whole number of steps stops short of `Max` rather than adding an unevenly spaced final value. `Min == Max`, or a step of zero, is a single fixed delay rather than an error — that is what an operator narrowing the list passes through on the way down.

**Why the step is not `StimDelayList.Value`.** It reads like the obvious place for it, and it cannot work: `hw.Parameter` clamps `Value` into `[Min Max]` on every assignment, and `gui.components.Parameter_Control` limits the edit field to the same range. A 250 ms step in a 1000–4000 ms list would silently become 1000, both when written and when typed. `StimDelayStep` is a parameter of its own whose `Min`/`Max` really are bounds on its value. The selector creates it, seeded from `StimDelayList`'s own value, so a protocol that only defines the list still works — and `stimDelayValues` falls back to `StimDelayList.Value` when no step parameter exists at all.

**`StimDelay.isRandom` is held false** for the whole session while block randomization is on, re-asserted on every selection pass so a phase load cannot turn it back on underneath the sequence. `randomize_value` runs inside `set.Value`, so an `isRandom` left true would overwrite the balanced value at dispatch. The two mechanisms are alternatives, not layers — which is why the GUI's "Randomize Stimulus Delay" checkbox is bound to `StimDelayBlockEnabled` here rather than to `isRandom`.

**Repeat on abort is a held index.** Because the caller owns the index, repeating a delay after an abort means simply not advancing it: the next trial reads the same position and gets the identical value, jitter included. Nothing is stashed and no randomization is suspended. The third consecutive abort releases the hold, as it always did.

**Training mode wins.** While `StimDelayTrainingEnabled` is on, `gui.AdaptiveTraining` steps `StimDelay` itself and writes it into the trials table; the sequence stands down for the duration without clearing the operator's checkbox, so switching training off resumes where the sequence stood.

**Editing the list mid-session** is safe: `epsych.BlockSequence` freezes the values already delivered and regenerates only from the next whole block, so retuning the list does not rewrite the subject's history. The abandoned partial block is logged at operator level.

**Trial 1 keeps its compiled delay.** `ep_TimerFcn_Start` does not install the trials table on the runtime until after the session-start `selectNext` returns, so there is nowhere for the selector to write on the first trial; the sequence starts at trial 2, consuming no index for trial 1. This is what the depth staircase already does — step 1 above returns the first stimulus row without touching `Depth` either.

The generated sequence's seed is logged at level 1 when it is built, so a run can be reconstructed; `BlockSequence.toStruct` is available if a save function wants the sequence itself.

A protocol **without** `StimDelayList` gets none of this. `StimDelay` is left entirely to `isRandom` and the `UserData.CORRECTVAL` machinery, exactly as before.

## Reminder trials

`cl_AppetitiveDetection_BehaviorGUI`'s **Reminder** button sets `ReminderTrials` to `1`. That is all it does: the request is **queued, not immediate**. The trial in progress runs to its natural end and the reminder is presented as the next trial. The button's `PostUpdateFcn` only logs the press — it deliberately does *not* set `TRIALS.FORCE_TRIAL`, which ended the trial in progress early and wrote a `DATA` record from a response the subject had not finished making. Everything about *what* the reminder is lives here, in the selector.

A reminder is a **signal-present trial at 0 dB depth** — full modulation, the most salient stimulus the task produces — regardless of where the staircase currently sits. `forceReminderTrial_` writes that depth into the reminder row of the live trials table rather than reading whatever the protocol compiled there, so the reminder does not depend on the protocol's `Depth` values.

The trial keeps `TrialType = 2`, which is what makes the override safe:

- the staircase measures from the last completed **stimulus** trial, so the reminder's 0 dB never becomes `lastStim`
- the catch-trial hazard ignores reminder trials, so the catch schedule is neither advanced nor reset
- the Next Trial panel and the Response History label the trial from `TrialTypeNames`, so it reads as `Reminder` rather than as an anomalous stimulus trial

### The reminder is invisible to the schedule

A reminder takes the next trial's slot and changes nothing else: **subsequent trials continue exactly as they would have had no reminder been presented.** A reminder is an operator interruption, not a measurement of the subject, so its own outcome is not a datum — scoring it as a hit must not walk the staircase down, and scoring it as a miss must not walk it up.

`selectNext` gets this by construction rather than by special cases:

1. Reminder trials are removed from the decoded history (`RC`, and the matching `Depth` vector) before anything reads it, so every `(end)` in the staircase and catch logic refers to the last *real* trial.
2. The reminder override is applied **last**, after the staircase step, the hazard advance, and the catch draw have all run. The trial the reminder displaces is therefore scored on the pass that grants the reminder, not a trial later.
3. The hazard's advance-once guard is keyed on the **count of completed non-reminder trials** (`lastHazardOutcome_`), not on `TrialIndex`. A reminder adds a `TrialIndex` but no outcome, so it can neither advance the hazard nor let the trial before it advance the hazard twice.

The one thing a reminder does consume is the catch **draw** made on the pass that grants it: that draw's result is discarded and re-made for the following trial, at the same (unchanged) probability.

`tmp/smoke_test_reminder_trial.m` proves the invariant directly — it runs the same outcome sequence twice, once with a reminder spliced in and once without, and requires the staircase to land on the same depth.

### The request is consumed when it is granted

`ReminderTrials` is a one-shot, and the selector clears it in the same `selectNext` pass that acts on it (`consumeReminderRequest_`). It cannot be cleared on trial completion instead, because `ep_TimerFcn_RunTime` broadcasts `NewData` for the completed trial *before* it calls `selectNext` for the next one. A listener that cleared the toggle there — as the behavior GUI's `onNewData` did — withdrew the request during the very pass that was about to honor it, so no reminder was ever presented.

Two consequences follow:

- The button clears as soon as the reminder is committed to, not when the reminder trial ends. It therefore stays lit exactly while the request is queued, which is the operator's only feedback that a press registered. A press made *during* a reminder trial is still standing at the next selection pass and produces a second reminder.
- `reminderIndex_` records the `TrialIndex` a reminder was granted for, so a repeated `selectNext` for the same trial — which any control that sets `FORCE_TRIAL` can produce — still returns the reminder row after the toggle is spent.

Two edge cases are reported rather than papered over:

- **No reminder row compiled.** Borrowing a stimulus row would overwrite the depth the staircase is holding there, so the selector logs at level 0 and presents an ordinary stimulus trial at the current depth instead.
- **`Depth.Max` below 0 dB.** `hw.Parameter` clamps `Depth` to its own bounds on dispatch, so a working maximum below full depth would quietly weaken the reminder. The selector logs at level 0 when this is the case; raise **Maximum Depth (dB)** if reminders must reach full depth.

Behavior is covered end to end by `tmp/smoke_test_reminder_trial.m`.

## Catch-trial hazard function

A flat catch probability produces geometric waiting times: long runs with no catch trial are common, so the false-alarm rate is estimated from an unevenly spaced sample. The selector instead raises the probability with each stimulus trial, which clusters the waiting times around the target rate.

The probability is **carried forward on the selector** and advanced by the one trial that just completed:

```
delivered stimulus trial  ->  p = p + P_Catch.Value
completed catch trial     ->  p = P_Catch.Min
aborted or reminder trial ->  p unchanged
then, every trial         ->  p = min(max(p, P_Catch.Min), P_Catch.Max)
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `P_Catch.Min` | floor: the probability at session start and immediately after a catch trial |
| `P_Catch.Value` | step added per delivered stimulus trial |
| `P_Catch.Max` | ceiling the probability is clamped to |

With `Min = 0`, `Value = 0.1`, `Max = 1` the probability runs 0, 0.1, 0.2, … and reaches certainty on the tenth stimulus trial, so no run of stimulus trials can exceed ten.

Because the value accumulates rather than being recomputed from history, **an operator edit applies from that point forward and is never retroactive**. Five stimulus trials at `Value = 0.1` sit at 0.5; raising the step to 0.2 takes the next trial to 0.7, not to 1.0. The `Min`/`Max` clamp is re-applied every trial, so tightening the bounds takes effect immediately rather than waiting for the next step.

**Aborts are inert on both sides of the schedule.** An aborted stimulus trial never delivered a stimulus, so it does not advance `p`; an aborted catch trial never measured a false-alarm rate, so it does not reset `p`. A run of aborts therefore leaves the catch rate exactly where it was. Reminder trials (`TrialType == 2`) never reach the rule at all — they are dropped from the history before it is read.

`cl_AppetitiveStimDetect.advanceHazard` is a static, runtime-free implementation of the step rule above. The selector applies it at most once per completed trial, keyed on the count of completed **non-reminder** trials, so neither a repeated `selectNext` for the same trial nor an intervening reminder can double-advance the hazard. `tmp/smoke_test_pcatch_hazard.m` is the standing proof of the schedule.

### The live probability

On its first `selectNext` the selector creates a `P_Catch_Current` parameter on the `hw.Software` interface and writes the current `p` to it every trial. `cl_AppetitiveDetection_BehaviorGUI` shows it in the **Trial State** monitor, and because it is a visible, readable parameter it also lands in every saved `DATA` record, so the hazard state can be reconstructed offline.

Declaring `P_Catch_Current` in the protocol yourself is preferable — it then persists and serializes — and the selector will use the existing parameter rather than creating one. Either way it must be host-writable (not `Access = 'Read'`, which rejects every write) with `UpdateEveryTrial = false`, which is what keeps a mid-run recompile from giving it a trials-table column that dispatch would clobber.

### Switching catch trials off

Early training often wants no catch trials at all. `CatchTrialsEnabled` is a Boolean switch the selector consults before it schedules anything: while it is off, every trial is a stimulus trial and the hazard is **held at its floor** rather than left to accumulate — so switching catch trials back on resumes from the bottom of the schedule instead of firing a catch trial on the next draw.

`cl_AppetitiveDetection_BehaviorGUI` exposes it as the **Present Catch Trials** checkbox, which also greys out the `p(Catch)` fields while it is clear (the **Min / Max** row and the **Step** field), so the visible schedule and the running one cannot disagree.

Like `P_Catch_Current`, the parameter is created on the `hw.Software` interface at the selector's first `selectNext` when the protocol does not declare it — early enough for the behavior GUI, which `epsych.RunExpt` launches after `ep_TimerFcn_Start`. Declaring it in the protocol yourself is preferable (it then persists and serializes), and the same rules apply: host-writable, `UpdateEveryTrial = false`. A selector running without any of this — a protocol with no switch, or the runtime-free `epsych.SelfTest` pass — treats the parameter as absent, which means catch trials stay enabled.

### Caveats

- The hazard resets to `Min` at the start of every session; it is not carried across runs.
- `CatchTrialsEnabled` gates presentation only. The trials table still carries its catch row, and `P_Catch`'s `Min`/`Value`/`Max` keep whatever the operator last set.
- `hw.Parameter` clamps `Value` to `[Min Max]`. Since `Value` is the step and `Min`/`Max` the probability range, setting `Min = 0.2` silently clamps a step of 0.1 up to 0.2. Harmless at the intended `Min = 0`, but the clamp is silent.
- `hw.Parameter` does not validate `Min <= Max`. The GUI's widget limits prevent crossing them interactively, but a phase load or programmatic write can.

## Notes and caveats

- The selector assumes `epsych.BitMask.decode` returns logical fields `Hit`, `Miss`, `Abort`, `CorrectReject`, `FalseAlarm`, and `TrialType_<code>`.
- `onRecompile` re-reads the cached `StimDelay` column from `TRIALS.writeParamIdx`; a recompile that adds or removes a parameter shifts every column after it. Nothing else is rebuilt.
- Without `StimDelayList`, the abort/StimDelay logic stores a snapshot in `StimDelay.UserData` while randomization is suspended; the private helper `restore_stimdelay_randomization_` restores the flag. Under the block sequence that helper is a no-op — `isRandom` is never suspended, so restoring it would switch `randi` back on underneath the sequence.
