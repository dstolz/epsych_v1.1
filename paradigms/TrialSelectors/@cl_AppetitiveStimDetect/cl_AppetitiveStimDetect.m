classdef cl_AppetitiveStimDetect < epsych.TrialSelector
    % Trial selector for the appetitive stimulus-detection task.
    %
    % Implements the staircase, catch-trial handling, and reminder-trial override
    % used when this selector is configured as Protocol.Options.trialFunc.
    %
    % Required parameters:
    %   ReminderTrials, Depth_StepOnHit, Depth_StepOnMiss, P_Catch,
    %   RepeatDelayOnAbort, StimDelay, and Depth (Depth.Min/Depth.Max provide
    %   the staircase bounds) in TRIALS.parameters.
    %
    % Catch trials are scheduled by a hazard function rather than a flat
    % probability, so all three fields of P_Catch carry meaning:
    %   P_Catch.Min   - floor: the probability at the start of a session and
    %                   immediately after a catch trial
    %   P_Catch.Value - step added for every delivered stimulus trial
    %   P_Catch.Max   - ceiling the probability is clamped to
    % See advanceHazard and documentation/paradigms/cl_AppetitiveStimDetect.md.
    %
    % The Reminder button (ReminderTrials) brings the next trial forward and
    % presents it at 0 dB depth -- full modulation, the most salient stimulus
    % the task produces -- on the reminder row, so the trial re-engages the
    % subject without entering the staircase or the catch schedule. See
    % forceReminderTrial_. The request is a one-shot, consumed by the
    % selection pass that grants it -- see consumeReminderRequest_ for why it
    % cannot be cleared on trial completion instead.
    %
    % Catch trials can be switched off for a session through the
    % CatchTrialsEnabled parameter, which cl_AppetitiveDetection_BehaviorGUI
    % exposes as a checkbox. The selector creates it when the protocol does
    % not declare it, and an absent parameter means enabled. It is marked
    % PersistWithPhase, so the setting is saved into and restored from a phase
    % file like the rest of the stage's configuration.
    %
    % The stimulus delay is block-randomized when the protocol declares
    % StimDelayList. Its Min and Max are the ends of the delay list and
    % StimDelayStep.Value is the spacing, so 1000 / 4000 / 250 means
    % 1000:250:4000 ms; StimDelayJitter.Value adds +/-j ms to each delivered
    % value. Those feed an epsych.BlockSequence indexed by the selector, so
    % every delay appears exactly its share within each block instead of
    % merely on average -- which is what StimDelay.isRandom's randi([Min Max])
    % could not do. isRandom is consequently held FALSE for the whole session:
    % it redraws inside set.Value on dispatch and would throw the balanced
    % value away. cl_AppetitiveDetection_BehaviorGUI exposes the switch as the
    % "Randomize Stimulus Delay" checkbox over StimDelayBlockEnabled, which
    % the selector creates when the protocol does not declare it.
    %
    % The step needs a parameter of its own rather than living on
    % StimDelayList.Value, because hw.Parameter clamps Value into [Min Max]
    % -- a 250 ms step in a 1000-4000 ms list would silently become 1000. The
    % selector creates StimDelayStep, seeded from StimDelayList's own value,
    % so a protocol that only defines the list still works. See
    % ensureStimDelayStep and stimDelayValues.
    %
    % A protocol WITHOUT StimDelayList gets none of that: StimDelay is left
    % entirely to isRandom and the abort/CORRECTVAL machinery below, exactly
    % as before. See setupStimDelay_ and applyStimDelay_.
    %
    % The staircase step is a plain signed add: nextStim = lastStim +
    % Depth_StepOnHit (or OnMiss). The step carries its own sign, so a
    % negative Depth_StepOnHit is what steps down to a weaker stimulus.
    % Invert the staircase by negating the step value.
    %
    % Optional parameters:
    %   StimDelayList - Min and Max are the ends of the block-randomized delay
    %       list, as above. Absent means no block randomization.
    %   StimDelayStep - spacing between list values, in ms. Created by the
    %       selector when absent.
    %   StimDelayJitter - +/- jitter in ms applied to each delivered delay.
