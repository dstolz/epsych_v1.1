classdef cl_AppetitiveDetection_BehaviorGUI < gui.BehaviorGUI
    % cl_AppetitiveDetection_BehaviorGUI Appetitive detection task control GUI.
    %
    % OBJ = cl_AppetitiveDetection_BehaviorGUI(RUNTIME) creates the Caras Lab
    % appetitive detection GUI: trigger buttons, staircase and trial
    % parameter controls, sound controls, phase selection, a trial-state
    % monitor, the psychometric plot, a parameter scatter, a session
    % performance summary, a response history table, a session clock, a
    % Notes button opening the session notes (saved with the data as
    % Info.Notes; see gui.components.Notes), and a Regenerate Trial button that
    % re-dispatches the pending trial -- which interrupts a trial in
    % progress and asks nothing first (see gui.components.RegenerateTrial).
    %
    % Operator actions are recorded into those same session notes
    % automatically -- an Update Parameters commit, an autoCommit edit of a
    % staircase, catch-rate, or stimulus-delay setting, and every phase load
    % or save each add a trial-stamped entry (see epsych.SessionNotes.log
    % and gui.BehaviorGUI). The entries ride along in Info.Notes and the
    % trial journal, so they are part of the data set even for a session
    % where nothing was typed into the Notes window.
    %
    % This is the gui.BehaviorGUI-based version of cl_AppetitiveDetection_GUI_B.
    % The layout is the same; single-instance enforcement, figure creation,
    % position persistence, event listeners, Parameter_Update wiring, and
    % component teardown are inherited from gui.BehaviorGUI, so only build() and
    % the event hooks live here.
    %
    % Behavior is driven by a psychophysics.Staircase over the Depth
    % parameter, which is created by createPsych and therefore also supplies
    % the NewData event source for onNewData.
