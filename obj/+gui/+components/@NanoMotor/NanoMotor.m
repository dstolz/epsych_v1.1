classdef NanoMotor < gui.PopOut
    % obj = gui.components.NanoMotor(source, container, Name=Value)
    % Operator panel for the Arduino Nano DM320T stepper controller
    % (peripherals.NanoMotorControl) -- the motorized commutator -- built to
    % sit inside a gui.BehaviorGUI rather than in a window of its own.
    %
    % It is peripherals.NanoMotorControlGUI's job in a component's shape,
    % and it differs from that class in three ways:
    %
    %   1. It NEVER opens the serial port on its own. The constructor makes
    %      the driver object and stops there; the link opens when the
    %      operator presses Connect (or a paradigm calls connect). A rig
    %      whose commutator is switched off, unplugged, or being driven from
    %      another MATLAB still gets its behavior GUI -- the old window
    %      connected from its constructor and rethrew, so a missing
    %      controller took the window with it.
    %   2. The layout is one column of short rows with no label column:
    %      units live inside the fields ("60 RPM"), the port row doubles as
    %      the connection status, and the whole panel is ~150 px tall
    %      against the old window's 320. Every row is individually hideable,
    %      so a rig that only ever nudges the commutator can show two.
    %   3. It is a gui.PopOut, so the same panel opens in a window of its
    %      own -- and with ButtonOnly=true it IS just that button, for a GUI
    %      with no room to spare.
    %
    % The panel drives a controller handed to it, or one it constructs
    % itself, so it opens with or without hardware anywhere near it.
    %
    % Properties:
    %   SpeedRPM     - Jog speed, and the speed a Move is sent at (motor RPM)
    %   MoveAmount   - Move magnitude, in MoveUnits
    %   MoveUnits    - 'deg' (output-shaft degrees) or 'rot' (1 rot = 360 deg)
    %   Port         - Serial port selected in the panel
    %   Verbosity    - Driver print level: 'SILENT', 'INFO', 'DETAILED'
    %   SwapDirectionLabels - Exchange what the jog buttons SAY, for a drive
    %                  that reverses the output shaft (never what they send)
    %   Sections     - Parts of the panel currently shown (see SECTIONS)
    %   Motor        - The peripherals.NanoMotorControl being driven
    %   IsConnected  - True while the serial link is open (Dependent)
    %   IsJogging    - True while a jog is running (Dependent)
    %   PositionDeg  - Output-shaft position as of the last poll
    %   Status       - Status text as of the last poll
    %   ContextMenu  - The right-click menu; host GUIs may append items
    %
    % Methods:
    %   connect / disconnect  - Open or close the link on the selected port
    %   detectPort            - Probe the serial ports for a controller
    %   refreshPorts          - Re-read the serial port list into the dropdown
    %   jog / stopJog         - Start or stop continuous rotation
    %   stopMotion            - STOP: end a jog and cancel any running move
    %   move                  - Send MOVEDEG for MoveAmount in MoveUnits
    %   zeroPosition          - Set the position counter to zero
    %   show / hide           - Show or hide parts of the panel by name
    %   startPolling / stopPolling - Resume / pause the position readout
    %
    % Examples:
    %   % Inside a gui.BehaviorGUI build method
    %   obj.add('gui.components.NanoMotor', panelRig);
    %
    %   % Just a button; the panel lives in the window it opens
