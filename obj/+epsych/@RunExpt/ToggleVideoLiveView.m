function ToggleVideoLiveView(self)
% ToggleVideoLiveView(self)
% Open or close a display-only webcam view. VLC uses the same device, frame
% rate, resolution, and crop as a recording would, but runs without a --sout
% chain, so nothing reaches the disk. The VLC window carries a "NOT
% RECORDING" overlay and title, and the session window shows a matching
% banner, so a displayed stream is never mistaken for a recorded one.
%
% Available mid-session as well as between runs, so an operator can look in on
% a subject without ending the run. The VLC restart it performs blocks the
% trial loop for ~1 s (up to 8 s when closing a view), which is the price of
% opening or closing it during a session.
%
% Never throws: the view is a convenience, so a failure is reported and the
% session carries on.
