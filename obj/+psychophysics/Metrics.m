classdef Metrics
    % psychophysics.Metrics
    % Stateless signal-detection arithmetic, shared by every analysis class.
    %
    % Metrics is the single home for the psychophysics formulas the rest of
    % the toolbox reuses: the z-transform, d', criterion, likelihood-ratio
    % bias, the nonparametric A' and B'', and proportion correct. It holds no
    % data, no runtime, and no state -- every method is static and pure, so
    % the same call works online, offline, in a test, or at the command line.
    %
    % Rates of exactly 0 or 1 send the z-transform to infinity, and the
    % correction for that is a scientific choice rather than a detail, so it
    % is named at every call:
    %
    %   "none"       rates as given; 0 and 1 give -Inf and +Inf
    %   "clamp"      rates pulled into Bounds (default [0.01 0.99])
    %   "halfcell"   0 -> 1/(2N), 1 -> 1-1/(2N)    (Macmillan & Kaplan 1985)
    %   "loglinear"  every rate -> (nYes+0.5)/(N+1) (Hautus 1995)
    %
    % The last two depend on how many trials are behind a rate, so they need
    % NSignal/NNoise; asking for one without counts is an error rather than a
    % silent fall back to a clamp. fromCounts is the entry point that always
    % has them.
    %
    % Everything broadcasts: a vector of hit rates pairs with a scalar false
    % alarm rate. NaN propagates as NaN -- an undefined rate is never turned
    % into a bound, which is the difference between this class and the
    % min/max clamp it replaces.
    %
    % z and zinv are the Statistics Toolbox norminv and normcdf under names
    % that pair with each other; every d' in the toolbox goes through them.
    %
    % An aborted trial is the one judgement call in the denominators, and it
    % is an option rather than a convention: IncludeAborts defaults to false,
    % so a rate describes the trials the subject actually answered. See
    % rateDenominator.
    %
    % Methods (rates in):
    %   z / zinv          - Inverse and forward standard normal CDF
    %   rate              - num./den, NaN where den == 0
    %   rateDenominator   - Scored trials, plus aborts if they are counted
    %   correctRates      - The correction itself, so a caller can see it
    %   dprime            - Sensitivity d' = z(H) - z(F)
    %   criterion         - c = -(z(H) + z(F))/2
    %   criterionRelative - c' = c/d', comparable across sensitivities
    %   lnBeta / beta     - Likelihood-ratio criterion
    %   aprime            - Nonparametric sensitivity A' (Grier 1971)
    %   bprimeprime       - Nonparametric bias B'' (Grier 1971)
    %   percentCorrect    - Balanced proportion correct, (H + 1 - F)/2
    %   dprime2AFC        - d' from 2AFC proportion correct
    %
    % Methods (counts in):
    %   fromCounts        - Every metric above from nHit/nMiss/nFA/nCR
    %
    % Example:
    %   psychophysics.Metrics.dprime(0.9, 0.1)              % 2.5631
    %   psychophysics.Metrics.dprime([0.6 0.8 1], 0.1, ...
    %       Correction="loglinear", NSignal=20, NNoise=20)
    %   S = psychophysics.Metrics.fromCounts(18, 7, 3, 22, Correction="loglinear");

    methods (Static)
        function n = z(p)
            % n = psychophysics.Metrics.z(p)
            % Inverse standard normal CDF -- the "z-transform" of a rate.
            %
            % A thin, named wrapper over the Statistics Toolbox norminv, so
            % every d' and criterion in the toolbox goes through one place and
            % the formula itself is MathWorks' to maintain. It was an erfcinv
            % expansion until 2026-09-11; that avoided a licence EPsych's
            % machines have anyway, at the cost of owning a numerical routine.
            %
            % The method is named z and NOT norminv, and that is load bearing
            % now that the body calls norminv: a static named norminv would
            % capture the unqualified call below and recurse. (The same
            % shadowing is why psychophysics.Detection.norminv -- a bounded
            % variant, still present as public API -- ever worked.)
            %
            % No correction is applied here. p == 0 gives -Inf and p == 1
            % gives +Inf, which is the honest answer; NaN yields NaN, and a p
            % outside [0 1] yields NaN. norminv agrees on every one of those.
            %
            % Parameters:
            %   p - Probabilities, any size.
            %
            % Returns:

            %
            % The Statistics Toolbox normcdf, named to pair with z. Generating
            % the rates a known d' and criterion would produce is how
            % tmp/smoke_test_metrics.m checks the arithmetic against theory
            % rather than against itself.

            %
            % "No trials of that kind" is not a rate of zero, and every

            %   num - Numerator counts.

            %
            % An aborted trial is one the subject never answered, and whether
            % it counts against the rate is a paradigm's decision rather than
            % a fact about the data: scoring it as a failure to respond makes
            % it an error, and leaving it out makes the rate a statement
            % about the trials that were actually completed.
            %
            % EPsych defaults to leaving them out -- an abort is usually a
            % lapse of engagement rather than a wrong answer, and including
            % them makes a distracted session look insensitive rather than
            % incomplete. Every class that computes a rate takes an
            % IncludeAborts option and routes through this one function, so
            % the convention is stated in one place instead of four.
            %
            % Parameters:
            %   nScored       - Answered trials (Hit + Miss, or FA + CR).

            %   includeAborts - Add them to the denominator.

            % Returns:
