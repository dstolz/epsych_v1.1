function s = sessionVectors_(obj)
% s = sessionVectors_(obj)
% Per-trial vectors shared by the recompute and by the plot.
%
% One plot update used to walk the whole session eight times over: the
% stimulus values were extracted for the points, again for the threshold
% and again just to count trials, and the response codes were extracted
% and decoded once per trial-type mask and once per plotted series. They
% are built once here instead, and held until the trials, the trial-type
% selection, or the exclusions behind them change.
%
% Parameters:
%   obj — psychophysics.Staircase instance
%
% Returns:
%   s — struct with fields:
%       .stimValues  1xN stimulus values
%       .respCodes   1xN uint32 response codes, empty when unavailable
%       .decoded     epsych.BitMask.decode(respCodes), [] when unavailable
%       .stimMask    1xN logical, trials counted as stimulus trials
%       .catchMask   1xN logical, trials counted as catch trials
%       .key         cache key the vectors were built for

key = {obj.trialCount, obj.excludedTrials_, ...
    obj.StimulusTrialType, obj.CatchTrialType};

% DATA carries no explicit TrialType field.
